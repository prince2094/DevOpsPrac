    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.</br></br>

        What does DevOps mean for teams? DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.</p>
